# Algorithm Studies

These are my study notes for algorithm studies, once, as a Back-end Developer, it is very important to have them in mind for problem solving. 

My notes start with "Algorithms - Grokking" book, as it is very well recommended, and brings this topic with a clever way, in order to provide a fun way to explain deep algorithm knowledge.

:warning: Please, note that the "grokking_algorithm" folder is a clone from the original repo. The one I called "my_grokkingbook_algorithm_studies" is the one I am using to fix everything I am learning from the book.
